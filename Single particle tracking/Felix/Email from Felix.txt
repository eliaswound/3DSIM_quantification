Hey Yale...

So I finshed a new version of the tracking software, now called FIESTA! If your lab is still using the software, it would be nice if your lab could test it too, so I can remove bugs that don't show up with our data.

What's new:
- Better interface: mouse selection (using shift and control to select more than one track) plus dragging a region to select tracks (adding with control)
- New zooming and panning using the scroll wheel (zoom) and scroll button (pan)
- Create kymographs that include the tracks
- Fast exporting of movies, including time, scale, tracks and even current position plus track name
- Two new models for molecule tracking
- Better skeletization of filaments
- new statistics tools
- Mac compatible
- Installation in any folder and no interfence on the MatLab path
- Easy installation of a tracking server (if available)

The FIESTA online installation and update is now password protected!
Your authentication - Username: GoldmanLab Password: pmiresearch

Installation guide:
copy fiesta.m to folder where FIESTA should be installed
run fiesta.m (either via command path or MatLab context menu "run")
follow instructions

I also attached a shortcut to the function, where you only need to change the path of MatLab and the folder of fiesta.m


Please report any bugs and feedback would be very much appreciated!
